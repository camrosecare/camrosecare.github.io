                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Camrose Little Angels implements Flight- Alberta’s Early Learning and Care Framework
Curriculum Framework. Children are provided with an environment which is open, engaging,
safe and nurturing for their growth and development. Activities are planned based on the Interest
of the child. All planned and unplanned activities are Child- centered, Interest based and
Open ended. Camrose Little Angels Daycare believes in providing an open, welcoming, and
inclusive environment for the children and staff where individual beliefs and values are as
important as collective ones and everyone is free to believe, practice and follow their spiritual,
religious and cultural values.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
Educators actively listen to children’s questions and bend at their level to explore possibilities
together with them as co-learners and co-researchers. Open ended, inclusive and
developmentally appropriate activities are planned, and observations are made. All aspects of
growth and development are considered during program planning. Educators extend children’s
learning and experiences by planning and extending the activities based on the observations
made. Learning stories are used as a reflection to document their competencies and dispositions
to learn within the healthy and positive play environments.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Camrose Little Angels Daycare believes that children are resourceful, capable and active learners
whose learning, growth and development are profoundly influenced by the quality care and
relationships they receive. It is every child's right to have an open, engaging, and responsive
environment where they explore the world through play.
<br><br>
Camrose Little Angels Daycare provides children’s experience in a safe and nurturing
environment where their social, emotional, physical and cognitive development is supported.
These environments are intended to promote positive self-identity and a sense of belonging.
Children will have open and flexible environments where playful exploration, problem solving,
and creativity are encouraged and purposely planned by the educators. Environments will reflect
a sense of belonging where children feel nurtured and supported.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Play is integral to children’s learning and richly formative in their capacity for relationship. Play
is the work of children. Camrose Little Angels believes that children experience the world
through play and educators play a pivotal role in providing these positive play experiences, and
becoming co-learners, co-researchers, and co-imagineers of possibilities.
